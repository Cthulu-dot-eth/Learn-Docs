# Welcome!

We have created the ENS Learn Docs to complement our technical documentation with more user-friendly information to ensure that you can get the most out of your ENS Name.

This information is continually evolving. We will be adding new articles, and any feedback is always appreciated.

### Getting Started

Articles in the Learn Docs are categorized into five different types, listed below:

1. **ENS Domain FAQ**\
   For information on Registrations & Extensions, ENS Records, How to use your ENS name, and integrating DNS Names.
2. **ENS Governance FAQ**\
   For information on Delegation & Voting, the ENS voting token and the DAO.
3. **ENS Support FAQ**\
   The Support FAQ answers common support questions received in the ENS Discord.
4. **Tutorials**\
   ****The tutorials provides in-depth explanations or walkthroughs that build on the topics discussed in the Learn docs.
5. **References**\
   ****The references section covers common terminology and concepts discussed in this document.
