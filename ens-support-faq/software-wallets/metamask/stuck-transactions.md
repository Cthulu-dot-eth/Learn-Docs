# Stuck transactions

Sometimes transactions in Metamask can get stuck without being performed. You can verify whether a transaction is stuck in Metamask or not by looking up your wallet on [Etherscan](https://app.gitbook.com/s/xrwlYyAIfYDt2f6pnsTE/) and comparing the transactions there to the ones visible in your wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
Transactions can get stuck in Metamask due to a bug in the UI. This is not the same as transactions that have _stalled_ due to too low gas fees.

### Clearing stuck transactions

In order to clear transactions stuck in Metamask you'll have to reset the wallet:

* Open up Metamask and select the multi-coloured circle to bring up settings

* Select _**Reset Account**_ and confirm

Now the stuck transaction should be cleared, and it should be possible to continue to use Metamask as normal.
