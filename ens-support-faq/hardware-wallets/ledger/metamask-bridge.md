# Metamask bridge

Sometimes the Metamask-Ledger bridge loses contact with the Ledger-device, resulting in transactions that are never prompted for confirmation on the Ledger device, and which shows up in the Metamask UI as "pending" in perpetuity.\
\
Those transactions are never performed on-chain, and needs to be cleared by following the instructions in [Stuck transactions](../../software-wallets/metamask/stuck-transactions.md).

After those instructions have been followed, disconnect your Ledger device, restart your browser, reconnect your Ledger and try again.
