# Unable to interact with smart contracts

### Enable blind signing (formerly called Contract Data)

Interacting with smart contracts such as ENS using your Ledger requires _**blind signing**_ to be enabled on your device.

* Start and unlock your Ledger Nano S or X.
* Open the Ethereum app.
* Go to Settings -> Blind signing and press both buttons to enable it.

Now you should be able to interact with smart contracts and ENS.
