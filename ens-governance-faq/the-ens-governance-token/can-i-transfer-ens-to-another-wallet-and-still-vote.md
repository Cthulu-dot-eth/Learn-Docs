# Can I transfer ENS to another wallet and still vote?

Yes. It's possible to keep your ENS voting tokens in one wallet and still be able to vote with another wallet. A common use-case is to keep valuable ENS voting tokens in a [cold wallet](../../references/common-terminology.md#cold-wallet), while voting with [hot wallet](../../references/common-terminology.md#hot-wallet).\
\
In order to do this you'd simply transfer the ENS voting tokens to the wallet you want to keep them in, and then use that wallet to delegate them to your other wallet.
