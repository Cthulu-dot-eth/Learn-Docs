# What is a Delegate?

ENS is entirely governed by the public through votes using the ENS voting token.\
Since not everyone has the time or interest to participate in the governance directly it's possible to delegate your tokens to someone you trust who will gain your voting power and vote for you, without your voting tokens ever leaving your wallet.\
\
You can change your delegation at any time (see [How to Delegate votes](how-to-delegate-votes.md))
