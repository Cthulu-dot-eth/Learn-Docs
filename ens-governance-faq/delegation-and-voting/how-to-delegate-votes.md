# How to Delegate votes

In order to vote in on- and off-chain votes you need to delegate your voting tokens either to yourself or to a delegate you trust.

* Go to the [ENS Delegation-page](https://delegate.ens.domains/delegate-ranking)
* Connect your wallet on the upper right hand side

* Either choose a delegate from the list, or use the Enter _**ENS or address**_-button to enter an address to delegate to manually.

* Once you've chosen a delegate, press the "Delegate"-button and approve the transaction in your wallet. This transaction will incur a gas cost.

Keep in mind that for both on- and off-chain voting a snapshot is made of users vote counts at a specific block height. Changing your delegation after that block will not reflect your vote count in that vote, but will make sure that your vote count is reflected accurately in future votes.
