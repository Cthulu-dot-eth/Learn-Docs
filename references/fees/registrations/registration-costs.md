# Registration costs

The current costs for registering an ENS name are as follows:

* 5+ character .eth names: $5 in ETH per year
* 4 character .eth names: $160 in ETH per year
* 3 character .eth names $640 in ETH per year

{% hint style="info" %}
* 3 and 4 character names have 'premium' pricing to reflect the small number of these names available.
* Registering an ENS name requires ETH for the fee(s) and gas to mint the name onto the Ethereum blockchain. Registration fees go into the ENS DAO treasury.
{% endhint %}

if the name was previously owned by someone but recently released, it has a temporary decreasing premium to prevent squatters snatching up names. For more information about this, see [What is a premium auction?](../../../ens-domain-faq/registration-and-extensions/what-is-a-premium-auction.md)
